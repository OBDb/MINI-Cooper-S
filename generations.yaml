generations:
  - name: "First Generation (R53)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The first modern MINI Cooper S established the performance variant of BMW's reimagined MINI, featuring a supercharged 1.6-liter Tritec engine producing 163 horsepower (later increased to 170 hp) and 155 lb-ft of torque, paired with a standard six-speed Getrag manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic. Distinguished from the standard Cooper by its functional hood scoop (feeding the intercooler), more aggressive body styling, twin center-exit exhaust, and unique 16-inch or 17-inch wheel designs. Performance was brisk with 0-60 mph times of approximately 7.0 seconds and a top speed around 135 mph. The suspension was specially tuned with firmer springs, stiffer damping, and larger anti-roll bars, delivering the exceptional handling dynamics that quickly established the model's reputation. Additional performance features included larger brake discs and standard traction control. Special edition models included the Cooper S Works (with a factory-approved John Cooper Works package boosting output to 200 horsepower) and the limited-production Cooper S GP with reduced weight, aerodynamic enhancements, and exclusive features. The R53 Cooper S proved that a modern small car could deliver premium performance and character, becoming a benchmark for small sporting hatches and establishing a successful performance sub-brand within the MINI lineup."

  - name: "Second Generation (R56)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation Cooper S transitioned from supercharging to turbocharging, utilizing a new 1.6-liter turbocharged Prince engine co-developed with PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n, producing 172 horsepower (later increased to 181 hp) and 177/192 lb-ft of torque with an overboost function. The new powerplant delivered improved efficiency alongside enhanced performance with 0-60 mph times reduced to around 6.7 seconds. Visually distinguished from the standard Cooper by its mesh grille, functional hood scoop (though now drawing air for the turbocharger rather than an intercooler), central exhaust, and unique wheels. The chassis featured performance-oriented suspension tuning, larger brakes, and enhanced stability control with an available electronic differential lock. The interior maintained MINI's distinctive retro-themed design but with improved materials, supportive sport seats, and additional performance displays. Special variants included the JCW (John Cooper Works) model becoming a full factory variant rather than a dealer-installed package, producing up to 208 horsepower, and the limited-production Cooper S GP II with 211 horsepower, adjustable coilover suspension, unique aerodynamics, and lightweight components. This generation refined the Cooper S formula with more sophisticated technology and improved daily usability while maintaining its distinctive character and engaging driving dynamics."

  - name: "Third Generation (F56)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The third-generation Cooper S featured BMW's modern turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (B48) producing 189 horsepower (later 192 hp) and 206/221 lb-ft of torque with overboost, representing a significant increase in displacement and output over its predecessor. Built on BMW's UKL1 platform, it grew slightly in all dimensions to improve passenger space and crash safety. Performance improved with 0-60 mph times of approximately 6.4 seconds for manual models. Transmission options included a six-speed manual, six-speed automatic, and later a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Visual differentiation included a more pronounced hood scoop, unique front bumper with larger air intakes, dual central exhaust outlets, and distinctive wheel designs. The suspension was retuned for improved comfort without sacrificing handling prowess, with available adaptive dampers offering adjustable ride characteristics. The interior featured higher quality materials, improved technology including an available 8.8-inch touchscreen, and more refined controls while maintaining MINI's distinctive design elements. The JCW version became more differentiated with up to 228 horsepower and substantial chassis modifications. A mid-cycle refresh in 2018 brought styling updates, improved technology, and enhanced efficiency, while a 2020 update standardized previously optional driver assistance features and further refined the powertrains. This generation successfully balanced MINI's distinctive sporting character with notably improved refinement, technology, and daily usability, positioning the Cooper S as a premium performance option in the compact segment."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (J01)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Cooper S adopts MINI's new minimalist design language, featuring a cleaner exterior with simplified surfaces, redesigned lighting elements incorporating matrix LED technology, and a more sophisticated overall appearance. Powered by an updated version of BMW's 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine now producing 201 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired with a standard 7-speed dual-clutch transmission driving the front wheels. This powertrain enables 0-62 mph acceleration in approximately 6.6 seconds. Distinguished from the base Cooper by unique wheel designs, sportier bumpers, a subtle rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets integrated into the rear diffuser. The interior represents a dramatic reimagining of MINI's cabin design with a minimalist dashboard dominated by a large round 9.4-inch OLED central touchscreen that incorporates most vehicle functions, complemented by a new toggle bar for essential controls and a small digital instrument display. New technology includes augmented reality navigation, advanced driver assistance systems, and a customizable ambient lighting system that forms a complete ring around the central display. Chassis tuning emphasizes the model's sporting character with a wider track, retuned suspension, and enhanced stability control systems. For the first time, the Cooper S shares its exterior design language with the electric Cooper SE, though they utilize different platforms (the combustion models retain an evolution of the previous UKL architecture). This generation continues the Cooper S tradition of offering engaging performance in a distinctive package while incorporating modern technology, improved efficiency, and a fresh interpretation of MINI's iconic design."
